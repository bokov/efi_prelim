Analysis of Electronic Frailty Index pilot data.

## Variable naming conventions

* `v123_something_xx`: Directly generated by DataFinisher. The `v123` prefix 
  is the order of the parent data element in the query (e.g. 123). This order
  is alphabetically assigned due to upstream limitations, and will likely change
  with each data refresh. The `_something_xx` portion of the should usually be 
  stable but isn't necessarily unique. The `_xx` suffix indicates how this 
  variable is represented (e.g. `_tf` is TRUE/FALSE, `_cd` is a list of distinct
  codes, `_mn` is a numeric value or median of values if several were present in
  the raw data for that code and encounter).
* `vi_something`: Generated during post-processing and is an *i*ndicator 
  variable that aggregates a collection of raw indicator variables (i.e. is 
  true if any of its components are true during an encounter) or by filtering
  a raw multi-values variable (e.g. picking out a specific department from a 
  provider specialty column)
* `v_something` is a renamed variable, because the original's name was too long
  or too obscure.
* `z_something` is a derived variable for internal use, for processing other 
  variables and not intended for direct analysis
* `a_something` is an analytic variable created by these scripts from the `v` 
  and sometimes `z` variables.
