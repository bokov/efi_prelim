#' abstract: 'We have found that the electronic frailty index (EFI), a risk
#'   score developed using the Rockwood deficit-accumulation framework, is
#'   a strong predictor of falls, hospitalizations, hospital-acquired
#'   infections, and loss of independence without relying on any predictors
#'   including patient age. In fact, EFI outperformed patient age as a
#'   predictor. EFI''s accuracy was not negated by the fact that we used
#'   patients of all ages, not just older patients.'

# intro ----
#'
#' # Introduction
#'
#' Frailty is the lifelong erosion of stress resistance and accumulation of
#' impairments across multiple physiological systems. Among older community
#' dwelling adults 32% have been classified as pre-frail and 24% have been
#' classified as frail [@hoover13]. Frailty predicts disability,
#' injurious falls, and mortality [@pajewski19], emergency room visits
#' and hospitalizations [@fried01a], and long-term care admissions
#' [@pajewski19; @rockwood06; @rockwood05]. The Fried phenotype
#' [@fried01a] and Rockwood deficit accumulation index
#' [@rockwood07; @mitnitski01a], are the most commonly used methods for
#' operationalizing frailty. There is reasonable convergence between these
#' two approaches [@li15; @malmstrom14] but the deficit accumulation
#' approach does not require individual questionnaires nor physical
#' assessments yet offers similar [@malmstrom14] or possibly better
#' [@kulminski08] predictive accuracy.
#'
#' Possible points still left to cover:
#'
#' -   outcomes important to clinical care of older patients
#'
#' -   how care could be improved with better modeling of these outcomes
#'
#' -   information about our site

# methods ----
#' # Methods
#'
#' ## Population
#'
#' A random 1% sample (N=14,844) was drawn from the deidentified patient
#' records of a large academic health center and its teaching hospital
#' partner. Visits during which patient age was less than 18 years old were
#' excluded and then patients who had fewer than three visits in the
#' remaining data were excluded. To avoid bias, for each patient an index
#' visit date was chosen and only data recorded on or after that date was
#' used in analysis. To avoid distorted results in patients with sparse
#' visit histories, those who had fewer than two visit-dates after index
#' visit assignment were removed from the sample as were patients whose EFI
#' was never higher than 0. Finally, the patients were randomly assigned to
#' a development cohort (N=2,497 patients, 52,372 visit-days) or a testing
#' cohort (N=3,220 patients, 56,320 visit-days). Sensitivity analysis was
#' done to see the effect of leaving in data from all visits by adult
#' patients and the overall direction of EFI's effect was the same but
#' [the performance improvement relative to patient age was inflated].
#' All decisions about data processing and statistical analysis were made
#' using only the development cohort and blinded to the testing cohort. For
#' publication, the same analysis scripts were run on the testing cohort
#' and used to create all results reported here (the development version of
#' each table and figure is available in the supplemental materials). The
#' baseline characteristics of the testing cohort are shown in Table
#' \@ref(tab:table1).

#' ## Electronic Frailty Index
#'
#' @clegg16a developed an electronic frailty index (EFI) for UK health systems
#' following the methodology of Mitnitsky, Rockwood, et al.
#' [@mitnitski01a; @song10; @searle08a]. Recently, @pajewski19 adapted the EFI
#' to use ICD10 and ICD9. We further built on this work by also mapping
#' laboratory tests to specific LOINC codes. For each patient visit, all
#' distinct diagnoses and abnormal lab results over the preceding two-year
#' window for that patient were aggregated into a single EFI, a numeric value
#' that can range from 0 to 1 (but in practice seldom exceeded 0.6). As
#' mentioned above, we omitted all visits prior to a randomly select index
#' visit for each patient. This did not interfere with EFI calculation because
#' those EFI values were calculated separately for every distinct patient-date
#' in our health system, and then joined to the EHR data.
#'
#' ## Outcomes
#'
#' The primary outcomes we predicted with EFI were falls (any ICD9 codes in
#' E880-E888.9, E987.x, V00.x, or ICD10 codes in W00-W19), hospital
#' admissions (EHR encounter type = 'inpatient'), hospital-acquired
#' infections (having any ICD10 code associated with hospital-acquired
#' infections per Southern et al. @southern17 ), discharge to
#' intermediate care facilities (ICF) or skilled nursing facilities (SNF)
#' (using discharge disposition codes, for patients whose admit-source for
#' that encounter was 'Home'), and all-cause mortality insofar as it can be
#' ascertained from the EHR discharge disposition or vital status (which,
#' in the absence of linkage to external death indexes are likely to
#' under-report the actual mortality and so should be interpreted with
#' caution).
#'
# . stats ----
#' ## Statistical Analysis
#'
#' For each outcome of interest, we used a Cox proportional hazard model to
#' estimate the risk of the first occurrences of the outcome after the
#' patients' respective index visits using EFI as the predictor. Unlike
#' earlier studies, we treated EFI as a time-varying numeric predictor with
#' multiple followups per patient. Since only the first occurrence was
#' being predicted, a recurring event model was not necessary. As a
#' comparison, for each outcome a second analysis was done that was
#' identical to the first except that patient age at visit (in days) was
#' used as the predictor.
#'
# results ----
.resultsfold <- subset(tb2,outcomevar %in% v(c_truefalse)) %>%
  with(paste0(round(exp(estimate),1),'-fold for ',Outcome)) %>% tolower %>%
  submulti(cbind(c('icf','snf')
                 ,c('ICF','SNF after having been admitted from home')));
#' # Results
#'
#' Table \@ref(tab:tb2) shows the results of Cox proportional hazard models for
#' each of the responses, with EFI as the predictor. For each 0.1 increase in
#' EFI, we found at least a doubling of risk: `r pander(.resultsfold)`.
#' Furthermore, the probability of delayed discharge increased and thus longer
#' stays were observed in patients with an EFI > 0.19.
#' The p-values shown have been adjusted for multiple comparisons
#' (`r as.english(nrow(tb2)) %>% as.character` outcomes reported in
#' one study) using the @holm79 method and in all cases are highly
#' significant. It is well established in gerontology that an enormous and
#' diverse range of poor health outcomes are correlated with an individual's
#' age, but chronological age provides no information about the progression of
#' biological age in an individual. It has long been a priority in aging
#' research to find a metric for aging that is subject to individual variation
#' and intervention. Rockford et al. have pointed out {ref} that deficit
#' accumulation has the hallmarks of such a measure.

  pander(digits=3, caption='(\\#tab:tb2) Cox-proportional hazards with EFI as a predictor');
#'
#' Therefore, we compared the predictive accuracy of the EFI to that of
#' patient age. For each outcome, we fit an additional Cox proportional
#' hazard model, this time using age at visit as the predictor variable. It
#' appears, at least in this population, that not only can EFI accurately
#' predict mortality and poor patient outcomes without any knowledge of
#' patient age but it does so better than patient age.

# discussion ----
#' # Discussion
#'
#' Our data shares the fundamental limitation of the EHR system from which
#' it was obtained: like all EHR systems, it only has information that
#' providers and coders put into it. Events taking place outside the health
#' system or at un-connected health systems are not visible to our analysis.
#' On the other hand, providers who rely on EHR systems at point of care
#' are also working under these limitations on. The data we used is
#' representative of this scenario, and despite the limitations EFI
#' provides accurate predictions of poor patient outcomes. Because our
#' implementation of the Rockwood index real EHR data, it is more directly
#' transferable to clinical use than implementations based on curated
#' registries. This suggests that EFI is most accurate for patients who
#' have accumulated a reasonable in-system visit-history. Further work is
#' needed to find a more precise relationship between the length of a
#' patient's visit-history and the accuracy of EFI and better distinguish
#' genuinely non-frail patients from those who get most of their care
#' outside the researchers' health system.
#'
#' Vital status is often out of date in EHR systems if the patient did not
#' die in the hospital or shortly after their visit, so our data may
#' under-represent the true mortality rates. Nevertheless, the relationship
#' between EFI and mortality risk observed here agrees with previous EFI
#' studies. Unlike previous studies we sampled all adults rather than just
#' older adults so we could assess the performance of EFI across the
#' lifespan and include individuals who might have early-onset frailty.
#'
#' There is no gold standard method to assess Frailty in clinical practice.
#' Currently available frailty assessment tools used in geriatric practice have
#' good validity (for example @fried01a) but these are time
#' intensive and often difficult to implement in a busy general practice.
#' Assessing frailty helps clinicians identify high risk patients and tailor
#' interventions to prevent health decline and poor outcomes. Because of the
#' simplicity of the Rockwood Frailty Index, it is more likely to be adopted by
#' clinicians in a busy practice.
#'
#' Other possible points to cover:
#'
#' -   What we learned by not restricting the sample to older adults (or
#'     move to methods/theory paper?)
#'
#' -   What agrees and what disagrees with previous work?
#' -   What is new?
#'     -   Per-visit EFI allows plotting an EFI trajectory over time
#'     -   Strictly limiting data elements to those we can count on being
#'         available in any EHR system, at any site
#' -   future work
#' -   theoretical and practical implications
