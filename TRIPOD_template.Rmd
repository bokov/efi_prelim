# Introduction/Background

[TRIPOD 3.a] Explain the medical context (including whether diagnostic or prognostic) and rationale for developing or validating the multivariable prediction model, including references to existing models.

[TRIPOD 3.b] Specify the objectives, including whether the study describes the development or validation of the model or both.

# Methods

## Source of data

[TRIPOD 4.a] Describe the study design or source of data (e.g., randomized trial, cohort, or registry data), separately for the development and validation data sets, if applicable.

[TRIPOD 4.b] Specify the key study dates, including start of accrual; end of accrual; and, if applicable, end of follow-up. 

## Participants

[TRIPOD 5.a] Specify key elements of the study setting (e.g., primary care, secondary care, general population) including number and location of centres.

[TRIPOD 5.b] Describe eligibility criteria for participants. 

[TRIPOD 5.c] Give details of treatments received, if relevant. 

## Outcome
[TRIPOD 6.a] Clearly define the outcome that is predicted by the prediction model, including how and when assessed. 

[TRIPOD 6.b] Report any actions to blind assessment of the outcome to be predicted. 

## Predictors
[TRIPOD 7.a] Clearly define all predictors used in developing or validating the multivariable prediction model, including how and when they were measured.

[TRIPOD 7.b] Report any actions to blind assessment of predictors for the outcome and other predictors. 

## Sample size

[TRIPOD 8] Explain how the study size was arrived at.

## Missing data

[TRIPOD 9] Describe how missing data were handled (e.g., complete-case analysis, single imputation, multiple imputation) with details of any imputation method. 

## Statistical analysis methods

[TRIPOD 10.a, development only] Describe how predictors were handled in the analyses. 
[TRIPOD 10.b, development only] Specify type of model, all model-building procedures (including any predictor selection), and method for internal validation.

[TRIPOD 10.c, validation only] For validation, describe how the predictions were calculated. 

[TRIPOD 10.d] Specify all measures used to assess model performance and, if relevant, to compare multiple models. 

[TRIPOD 10.e, validation only] Describe any model updating (e.g., recalibration) arising from the validation, if done.

## Risk groups

[TRIPOD 11] Provide details on how risk groups were created, if done. 

## Development vs. validation

[TRIPOD 12, validation only] For validation, identify any differences from the development data in setting, eligibility criteria, outcome, and predictors. 

# Results

## Participants

[TRIPOD 13.a] Describe the flow of participants through the study, including the number of participants with and without the outcome and, if applicable, a summary of the follow-up time. A diagram may be helpful. 

[TRIPOD 13.b] Describe the characteristics of the participants (basic demographics, clinical features, available predictors), including the number of participants with missing data for predictors and outcome. 

[TRIPOD 13.c, validation only] For validation, show a comparison with the development data of the distribution of important variables (demographics, predictors and outcome). 

## Model development 

[TRIPOD 14.a, development only] Specify the number of participants and outcome events in each analysis. 

[TRIPOD 14.b, development only] If done, report the unadjusted association between each candidate predictor and outcome.

## Model specification

[TRIPOD 15.a, development only] Present the full prediction model to allow predictions for individuals (i.e., all regression coefficients, and model intercept or baseline survival at a given time point).

[TRIPOD 15.b, development only] Explain how to the use the prediction model.

## Model performance

[TRIPOD 16] Report performance measures (with CIs) for the prediction model.

## Model-updating

[TRIPOD 17, validation only] If done, report the results from any model updating (i.e., model specification, model performance).

# Discussion

## Limitations

[TRIPOD 18] Discuss any limitations of the study (such as nonrepresentative sample, few events per predictor, missing data). 

## Interpretation

[TRIPOD 19.a, validation only] For validation, discuss the results with reference to performance in the development data, and any other validation data. 

[TRIPOD 19.b] Give an overall interpretation of the results, considering objectives, limitations, results from similar studies, and other relevant evidence. 

## Implications

[TRIPOD 20] Discuss the potential clinical use of the model and implications for future research. 

# Conclusions

## Supplementary information

[TRIPOD 21] Provide information about the availability of supplementary resources, such as study protocol, Web calculator, and data sets. 

# Acknowledgments

[TRIPOD 22] Give the source of funding and the role of the funders for the present study.
